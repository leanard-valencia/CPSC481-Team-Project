							<h2>Augmented Reality Menu for Cubicle Restaurants</h2>
							<p>The adaptation of an AR menu in the greenhouse glass cubicles built in restaurants across Europe, especially the ones constructed in Amsterdam for social distancing owing to the ongoing pandemic. But why now make these dining out cubicles a trend ?! This is where our idea would give way to a novel yet fun experience that customers have probably thought of as fulfilling only the hygiene guidelines and losing out on the ‘real’ restaurant ambiance that they look out for. The implementation is in the sense that you can see the menu on the mirror of the glass cubicle (house designed) booth for the guests at the restaurant. You can with your bare eyes visualise your menu, with the additional features of do it yourself food also being able to be done through this AR. 
								We can incorporate the online delivery features that allow you to see your order being received by the chef, order being prepared, and the cherry on top, a robot getting it to your cubicle on a tray! We could also have a SIRI/Alexa function in the cubicle that helps one call out to say, the assistant chef (or an AI) in order to make quick changes or say address some allergies they might have not taken into account while placing the order, or any other question for that matter!</p>
							<h2> Home Repair And Services App</h2>
							<p>  A leaking faucet, clogged sink or a broken furnace are just some of the unforeseen circumstances homeowners have to deal with. Since most of these problems require immediate repair some homeowners will be under stressful situations finding the best service provider  in terms of service, fee, and other factors. One of our project ideas is to create a mobile app that will provide home services to users. The services include plumbing, electrical, cleaning, paint works  and many more house services. This is important because it can provide convenience to the user by having all the needed house services in just one application. This can help reduce the stress of the user when finding an immediate house repair. The app will be divided into different home services categories. It will also give the user the nearest service providers from his/her location. The app will also show service fees and customer reviews so that the users can make comparisons and help them make decisions. A calendar will be shown where customers can choose when they want to book a service. A feature that will narrow down the list for services that requires immediate appointment will be introduced as well.  This will also provide a live chat feature so that the users can further discuss any concerns or inquiries to the service providers. Receipts and invoices will also be available in the app. The user will also be asked to provide reviews for the providers in order to help future users. </p>
							<h2>Interactive Bus Stop Kiosk </h2>
							<p> The Interactive Bus Stop Kiosk aims to enhance the experience of bus commuters. This will benefit all the bus users but most importantly those who don’t have access to a phone or to the transit app to check for bus times. The kiosk will be introduced to bus stops and people can interact with it just like a mall navigation kiosk. The kiosk will show real time bus tracking. It will also show alerts when there is a delay on the arrival time and alternative bus options will be shown as well. Users will be able to plan their trip in the kiosk by searching their destination.  To minimize frequent touching, voice recognition will be introduced that will give the user the same experience without touching the kiosk. QR code can be scanned in the kiosk which will show personalized bus routes and bus times for a specific user. Commuters will also be able to choose which bus they are taking in a specific bus stop which will then alert the bus drivers which can minimize unnecessary stops made by buses by stopping for people on a bus stop which are waiting for another bus. </p>
